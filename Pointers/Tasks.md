### Slices and Arrays

1. **Simple array:** Create an array of 5 integers, initialize it, and print all its elements.

2. **Iterate through an array:** Create a function that takes an array as an argument and prints all its elements. Then use that function.

3. **Copying arrays:** Create two arrays of the same size, copy one to the other, and modify the values ​​in the copy. See if the changes affect the original.

4. **Simple slice:** Create a slice of integers, add some elements to it, and print the contents of the slice, its length, and capacity.

5. **Append:** Create a slice and use the append function to add new elements to it. See how the length and capacity of the slice change.

6. **Slice:** Create a slice with 10 elements, then extract a subslice from it that includes elements 3 through 7. Print the result.

7. **Copying a slice:** Create two slices and copy the elements from one slice to the other. See how the contents of both slices change after copying.

8. **Array vs Slice:** Create a function that takes an array and a slice, modifies their contents, and then prints the results. See how the effects of this function differ on an array and a slice.

9. **Slice in functions:** Create a function that takes an integer slice, modifies it (e.g. adds 1 to each element), and returns a new slice. See if the changes are visible when the function returns.

10. **Multi-dimensional slices:** Create a slice of slices (i.e. a matrix) and initialize it with values. Print all the elements of a matrix by iterating through its dimensions.
