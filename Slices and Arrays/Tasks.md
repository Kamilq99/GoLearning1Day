### Pointers

1. **Simple pointers:** Create an int variable, then a pointer to that variable. Modify the variable's value through the pointer and print the result.

2. **Pointers to structures:** Create a Person structure object, then a pointer to that object. Modify the data in the structure through the pointer and print the result.

3. **Functions that accept pointers:** Write a function IncreaseAge that takes a pointer to a Person structure and increases the age of the person by 1 year.

4. **Nil vs pointer:** Create a pointer to an int variable and set it to nil. Try to access the variable through the pointer and handle the error.

5. **Memory allocation:** Use the new function to create a pointer to an int variable. Initialize the variable through the pointer and print its value.

6. **Pointers to pointers:** Create an int variable, then a pointer to that variable, then a pointer to that pointer. Modify the value of the variable via a pointer to the pointer and print the result.

7. **Passing pointers:** Create a function that takes a pointer to an int variable, changes its value, and returns a pointer to that variable.

8. **Pointers in arrays:** Create an array of integers. Then create a pointer to the first element of the array and modify the value of that element via the pointer.

9. **Pointers and anonymous functions:** Create an anonymous function that takes a pointer to an int variable and modifies it. Call that function.

10. **Pointer Arithmetic (nonexistent in Go, but an alternative):** Try to implement a simple array lookup using a pointer, simulating pointer arithmetic (by iterating and moving the pointer to subsequent elements).
